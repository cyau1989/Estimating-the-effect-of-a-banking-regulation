# Estimating-the-effect-of-a-banking-regulation
This paper seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the Volcker rule announcement in reducing the trading ratio of banks in US. The results suggest that the purpose of Volcker rule is partially achieved, as the treated banks reduced the trading ratio more than the controlled banks after Dodd Frank Act was passed. Our model results are verified by robustness. However, not all banks comply with the rule. Therefore, we discussed the implications of the results to banks and regulators, the evaluation of the rule, and possible amendments to effectively regular the risk taking level of the overall banking industry.
